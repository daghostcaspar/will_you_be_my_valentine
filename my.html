    <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;"><br> I know you have taken chances before, and they left you high and dry. I know you are scared to start again after everything before this has failed you—I am, too. But if I have to fail again, it is you I want to go down in flames with. I know that nothing ever works out, but if it does, it would be this; it would be here; it would be you and me and whatever this fire is between us. 💖<br>
      <br>I know you fight a lot of battles that you don't tell the world about. I hope one day, whenever that time comes, you will be comfortable enough to share them with me. Until then, please know that I'm here for you, a silent but unwavering support in your corner. I may not always understand the depth of what you're going through, but I can offer a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on.</br></p>
